PalindromeCheckerApp – UC7 (Deque-Based)
📌 Project Description

PalindromeCheckerApp is a simple Java console application that checks whether a given word or string is a palindrome using a Deque (Double-Ended Queue).

A palindrome is a word, number, or phrase that reads the same forward and backward.
Example: madam, level, radar.

🎯 Objective

The objective of this use case is to:

Understand the concept of Deque (Double-Ended Queue)

Practice Java Collections Framework

Implement optimized string comparison logic

Perform bidirectional traversal using a data structure

Strengthen problem-solving skills in Java

🔄 Project Flow

Display welcome message to the user

Ask the user to enter a word or string

Insert each character into a Deque

Remove and compare characters from the front and rear

If mismatch occurs → Not a palindrome

If all characters match → Palindrome

Display the result in the console

👤 Use Case

This application can be used:

By students to understand Deque operations

To learn efficient palindrome checking

To practice Java data structures

As a beginner-to-intermediate Java practice project

▶️ How to Run

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE)

Compile the file:

javac UseCase7PalindromeCheckerApp.java

Run the program:

java UseCase7PalindromeCheckerApp

Enter a word when prompted

View the result in the console
