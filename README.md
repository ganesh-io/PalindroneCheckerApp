# 📘 Palindrome Checker App - UC5

### A Console-Based Java Application for Efficient Palindrome Validation

## 📌 Overview
[cite_start]The **Palindrome Checker App** is a console-based Java application designed to validate whether a given string is a palindrome. [cite_start]This module (**UC5**) focuses on utilizing a **Stack** data structure to map classic LIFO behavior to palindrome reversal logic[cite: 91, 101].

## 🎯 Project Objective
* [cite_start]**Implement Stack Logic**: Use a linear data structure to reverse characters and validate symmetry[cite: 92].
* [cite_start]**Understand LIFO**: Reinforce the **Last In First Out** (LIFO) principle through practical application[cite: 98].
* [cite_start]**Strengthen Fundamentals**: Build core programming and data structure concepts within a Java environment.

## ✅ Use Case 5: Stack-Based Palindrome Checker

### 🔍 Objective
[cite_start]To design and implement a validation system that pushes characters into a stack and pops them in reverse order to compare with the original sequence[cite: 92, 112].

### 🧠 Technical Approach
* [cite_start]**Stack Behavior**: A stack naturally reverses the order of elements, making it an ideal choice for palindrome validation[cite: 101, 113].
* [cite_start]**LIFO Principle**: The last character added to the stack is the first one removed, allowing for a direct reverse-order comparison[cite: 98, 100, 108].



### 🏗 Data Structure Used
* [cite_start]**Stack**: A linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out principle[cite: 98, 102].
* **Key Operations**:
    * [cite_start]**Push Operation**: Used to insert characters into the stack[cite: 99].
    * [cite_start]**Pop Operation**: Used to remove characters from the stack in reverse order[cite: 100].

## 🔁 Execution Flow
1. [cite_start]**Input**: Declare and initialize an input string, such as "noon"[cite: 121].
2. [cite_start]**Push**: Iterate through the string and push each character into the stack[cite: 94, 124, 125].
3. [cite_start]**Pop & Compare**: Pop characters one by one and compare them with the original sequence to check for a match[cite: 95, 112].
4. [cite_start]**Display**: Print the final validation result to the console[cite: 96, 112].
